## 1.0 Basic Physics SE-Units

<article>

![0](media/1.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Units identify what a specific number represents. For example, the number 42 can be used to represent 42 miles, 42 pounds, or 42 elephants! Without the units attached, the number is meaningless. Also, correct unit cancellation can help you find mistakes when you work out problems.

**Key Concepts**

* Every calculation and answer to a physics problem must include units. Even if a problem explicitly asks for a speed in meters per second (m/s), the answer is 5 m/s, not 5.
* When you’re not sure how to attack a problem, you can often find the appropriate equation by thinking about which equation will provide an answer with the correct units. For instance, if you are looking to predict or calculate a distance, use the equation where all the units cancel out, with only a unit of distance remaining.
* This book uses _SI units_ (La Système International d’Unités).
* When converting speeds from one set of units to another, remember the following rule of thumb: a speed measured in _mi/hr_ is about a little more than double the value measured in _m/s_ (_i.e._, 10 m/s is equal to about 20 MPH). Remember that the speed itself hasn’t changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set of units.
* If a unit is named after a person, it is capitalized. So you write “10 Newtons,” or “10 N,” but “10 meters,” or “10 m.”
* Your weight is simply the force of gravity on you, so pounds are just the English version of Newtons

**Key Equations**

* 1 meter = 3.28 feet
* 1 mile = 1.61 kilometers
* 1 lb. (1 pound) = 4.45 Newtons
* 1 kg is equivalent to 2.21 lb. on Earth where acceleration of gravity is $9.8 \ m/s^2$

**An Example of unit conversion:**

20 m/s = ? mi/hr

20 m/s (1 mi/1600 m) = .0125 mi/s

.0125 mi/s (60 s/min) = .75 mi/min

.75 mi/min (60 min/hr) = 45 mi/hr

**Calculator 101 –TI83**

* **Arrow Keys:** Use the arrow keys to scroll around on the line that your typing your calculation and use the DEL key to delete anything. Use the insert key (type $2^{\text{nd}}$ then DEL) to add something in.
* **Calculator only does what you tell it to:** The order of operation is as follows and in order: exponents, multiplication and division, adding and subtracting.
* **Some useful tips:** The orange key in the upper left corner is very handy. If you hit this button first and then another key, the calculator will operate the command in orange above the key. Here are some good ones

__$\boxed{2^{\text{nd}}}$ then $\boxed{\text{ENTER}}$ = ENTRY: the calculator will repeat the last line. If you want the one above it, do it twice. Etc.__

$\boxed{2^{\text{nd}}}$ then $\boxed{(-)}$ = ANS: the calculator will put in the answer from last calculation into your equation

* **Scientific Notation:** On the calculator the best way to represent $3 \times 10^8$ is to type in 3E8, which means 3 times ten to the eighth power. You get the ‘E’ by hitting the $\boxed{2^{\text{nd}}}$ then $\boxed{,}$.
* **Common Problems:** _Student wants to divide 400 by_ $2 \pi$, but types ‘$400/2 \pi$’ into calculator. The calculator reads this as ‘400 divided by 2 and multiplied by $\pi$’. What you should do is either ‘$400/(2 \pi)$’ or ‘$400/2$’ enter then ‘$/\pi$’ enter.

___Student wants multiply 12 by the result of 365-90,_ but types in ‘$12*365-9$’. The calculator multiplies 12 by 365 _then_ subtracts 90. What you should do is type in ‘$12*(365-90)$’.__

_Negative Exponents:_ You must use the white ‘$(-)$’ key for negative exponents.

* **Rounding:** Round your answers to a reasonable number of digits. If the answer from the calculator is 1.369872654389, but the numbers in the problem are like 21 m/s and 12s, you should round off to 1.4. To report the full number would be misleading (i.e. you are telling me you know something to very high accuracy, when in fact you don’t). Do not round your numbers while doing the calculation, otherwise you’ll probably be off a bit due to the dreaded ‘round off error’.
* **Does your answer make sense:** Remember you are smarter than the calculator. Check your answer to make sure it is reasonable. For example, if you are finding the height of a cliff and your answer is 0.00034 m. That can’t be right because the cliff is definitely higher than 0.34 mm. Another example, the speed of light is $3 \times 10^8 \ m/s$ (i.e. light travels 300 million meters in one second). Nothing can go faster than the speed of light. If you calculate the speed of a car to be $2.4 \times 10^{10} \ m/s$, you know this is wrong and possibly a calculator typ-o.

**Key Applications**

The late, great physicist Enrico Fermi used to solve problems by making educated guesses. For instance, say you want to _guess_timate the number of cans of soda drank by everybody in San Francisco in one year. You’ll come pretty close if you guess that there are about 800,000 people in S.F., and that each person drinks on average about 100 cans per year. So, 80,000,000 cans are consumed every year. Sure, this answer is wrong, but it is likely not off by more than a factor of 10 (i.e., an “order of magnitude”). That is, even if we guess, we’re going to be in the _ballpark_ of the right answer. That is always the first step in working out a physics problem.

## 2.0 Basic Physics SE-SHM Wave

<article>

![0](media/3.png "Figure 1: _“I often think about music. I daydream about music. I see my life in the form of music.”_ - Albert Einstein")

**The Big Idea**

The development of devices to measure time like a pendulum led to the analysis of _periodic motion._ Motion that _repeats itself in equal intervals of time_ is called _harmonic motion._ When an object moves back and forth over the _same path_ in harmonic motion it is said to be _oscillating._ If the amount of motion of an oscillating object (the distance the object travels) stays the same during the period of motion, it is called _simple_ harmonic motion(SHM). A grandfather clock’s pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM.

Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period of time are said to be in _harmonic motion._ Objects in harmonic motion have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances. They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves transfer energy over a distance without direct contact of the initial source. In this sense waves are phenomena not objects.

**Key Concepts**

* The oscillating object does not lose any energy in SHM. Friction is assumed to be zero.
* In harmonic motion there is always a _restorative force_, which acts in the opposite direction of the velocity. The restorative force changes during oscillation and depends on the position of the object. In a spring the force is the spring force; in a pendulum it is the component of gravity along the path. In both cases, the force on the oscillating object is directly opposite that of the direction of velocity.
* Objects in simple harmonic motion do not obey the “Big Three” equations of motion because the acceleration is not constant. As a spring compresses, the force (and hence acceleration) increases. As a pendulum swings, the tangential component of the force of gravity changes, so the acceleration changes.
* The **period**, $T$, is the amount of time for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for the object to go one full cycle. In SHM, $T$ is the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point and starting direction.
* The **frequency**, $f$, is the number of cycles an object goes through in 1 second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec.
* The **amplitude**, $A$, is the distance from the _equilibrium_ (or center) _point_ of motion to either its lowest or highest point (_end points_). The amplitude, therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion but is constant in SHM.
* A **_medium_** is the substance through which the wave travels. For example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air molecules act as the medium for sound waves.
* When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only temporarily disturbed. When an ocean wave travels from one side of the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move this great distance. Only the _disturbance_ propagates (moves) through the medium.
* An object oscillating with frequency $f$ will create waves which oscillate with the same frequency $f$.
* The **speed** $v$ **and wavelength** $\lambda$ of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the wave travels.
* There are two main types of waves we will consider: **longitudinal** and **transverse** waves.
* In **longitudinal** waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the _same direction_ as the wave motion. A classic example is a wave traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in the same direction as the motion of the wave. A more physical example is a sound wave. For sound waves, high and low pressure zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them.
* In **transverse** waves, the vibrations of the medium are _perpendicular_ to the direction of motion. A classic example is a wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not from left to right as the wave does.
* Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves. A typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave passes through it.
* Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple harmonic motion.
* The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string is made of, as well as the tension in the string. This fact is why _tightening_ a string on your violin or guitar will _increase_ the frequency, or pitch, of the sound it produces.
* The speed of a sound wave in air depends subtly on pressure, density, and temperature, but is about 343 m/s at room temperature.

**Key Equations**

* $T = \frac{1}{f}$ ; period and frequency are inversely related
* $v = f \lambda$ ; wave speed equals wavelength times oscillation frequency
* $f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 -f_2|$ ; two interfering waves create a beat wave with frequency equal to the difference in their frequencies.
* $T_p =2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ ; the period of oscillation for a pendulum (i.e. a mass swinging string) swinging at small angles (say, $\theta < 15^\circ$) withdepends on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity.

**Key Applications**

* _Constructive interference_ occurs when two waves combine to create a larger wave. This occurs when the peaks of two waves line up.
* _Destructive interference_ occurs when two waves combine and cancel each other out. This occurs when a peak in one wave lines up with a trough in the other wave.
* When waves of two different frequencies interfere, a phenomenon known as _beating_ occurs. The frequency of a beat is the difference of the two frequencies.
* When a wave meets a barrier, it reflects and travels back the way it came. The reflected wave may interfere with the original wave. If this occurs in precisely the right way, a _standing wave_ can be created. The types of standing waves that can form depend strongly on the speed of the wave and the size of the region in which it is traveling.
* A couple typical standing waves are shown below. The first is the motion of a simple jump-rope. _Nodes_ are the places where the rope doesn’t move at all; _antinodes_ occur where the motion is greatest. The second is a string in its $5^{th}$ harmonic

![0](media/4.png "Figure 2: ![0](media/5.png)")

\[Figure 3\]

* Longitudinal waves, like sound waves, have compression and rarefaction zones. The compression zones are where, for example in a sound wave traveling through air, the air molecules are densely packed. The rarefaction zones are areas where the air molecules are loosely packed, like a vacuum zone. Us teachers will often draw longitudinal waves as transverse waves, but remember the difference.

![0](media/6.png "Figure 4: * The _DopplerEffect_ occurs when either the source of a wave or the observer of a wave (or both) are moving. When a source of a wave is moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is higher than that emitted. For instance, if a car approaches you while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will be slightly higher. The opposite occurs (the frequency observed is lower than emitted) for a receding wave or if the observer moves away from the source. It’s important to note that the speed of the wave does not change –it’s traveling through the same medium so the speed is the same. Due to the relative motion between the source and the observer the frequency changes, but not the speed of the wave. Note that while the effect is similar for light and electromagnetic waves the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound.")

**Solved Examples**

**Example 1:** A bee flaps its wings at a rate of approximately 190 Hz. How long does it take for a bee to flap its wings once (down and up)?

_Question:_ $T = ?$ \[sec\]

_Given:_ $f = 190 \ Hz$

_Equation:_ $T = \frac{1}{f}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{190 \ Hz} = 0.00526 \ s = 5.26 \ ms$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{5.26 \ ms}}$

**Example 2:** Wild 94.9 in San Francisco operates at a frequency of 94.9 MHz. What is the wavelength of these waves?

_Question:_ $\lambda = ? [m]$

_Given:_ $f = 94.9 \ MHz = 94.9 \times 10^6 \ Hz$

${\;} \qquad \quad v = c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \ m/s$

_Equation:_ $v = f \cdot \lambda$ therefore $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8 \ m/s}{94.9 \times 10^6 \ Hz} = 3.16 \ m$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{3.16 \ m}}$

**Example 3:** While on vacation in Hawaii you observe waves at the Banzai Pipeline approaching the shore at 6.0 m/s. You also note that the distance between waves is 28 m. Calculate (a) the frequency of the waves and (b) the period.

_Question_ **_a_**_:_ $f= ? [Hz]$

Given: $v = 6.0 \ m/s$

${\;} \qquad \quad \lambda = 28 \ m$

_Equation:_ $v = f \cdot \lambda$ therefore $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $f = \frac{v} {\lambda} = \frac{6.0 \ m/s}{28 \ m} = 0.21 \ Hz$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{0.21 \ Hz}}$

_Question_ **_b_**_:_ $T = ? [s]$

_Given:_ $f = 0.21 \ Hz$

_Equation:_ $T = \frac{1}{f}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.21 \ Hz} = 4.76 \ s$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{4.76 \ s}}$

    2.  What is the wavelength of a signal from KPOO (89.5 FM)?
    3.  If your antenna were broken off so that it was only 2 cm long, how would this affect your reception?
21. Below you will find actual measurements of acceleration as observed by a seismometer during a relatively small earthquake. ![0](media/11.png)\[Figure 9\]An earthquake can be thought of as a whole bunch of different waves all piled up on top of each other.
    1.  Estimate (using a ruler) the approximate period of oscillation $T$ of the minor aftershock which occurs around $t = 40$ sec.
    2.  Convert your estimated period from part (a) into a frequency $f$ in Hz.
    3.  Suppose a wave with frequency $f$ from part (b) is traveling through concrete as a result of the earthquake. What is the wavelength $\lambda$ of that wave in meters? (The speed of sound in concrete is approximately $v = 3200 \ m/s$.)
22. The speed of sound $v$ in air is approximately $331.4 \ m/s + 0.6 \ T$, where $T$ is the temperature of the air in Celsius. The speed of light $c$ is 300,000 km/sec, which means it travels from one place to another on Earth more or less instantaneously. Let’s say on a cool night (air temperature $10^\circ$ Celsius) you see lightning flash and then hear the thunder rumble five seconds later. How far away (in km) did the lightning strike?
23. Reread the difference between _transverse_ and _longitudinal_waves. For each of the following types of waves, tell what type it is and why. (Include a sketch for each.)
    * sound waves
    * water waves in the wake of a boat
    * a vibrating string on a guitar
    * a swinging jump rope
    * the vibrating surface of a drum
    * the “wave” done by spectators at a sports event
    * slowly moving traffic jams
24. For every vertical dashed line, add the two waves together and sketch the resultant wave on the third graph. Be as exact as possible. The two waves have different frequencies, but the same amplitude of 1 m. What is the frequency of the resultant wave? How will the resultant wave sound different? ![0](media/12.png)\[Figure 10\]
25. The simple bridge shown here oscillated up and down pretty violently four times every second as a result of an earthquake. ![0](media/13.png)\[Figure 11\]
    1.  What was the frequency of the shaking in Hz?
    2.  Why was the bridge oscillating so violently?
    3.  Calculate two other frequencies that would be considered “dangerous” for the bridge.
    4.  What could you do to make the bridge safer?
26. The length of the western section of the Bay Bridge is 2.7 km. ![0](media/14.png)\[Figure 12\]
    
    1.  Draw a side-view of the western section of the Bay Bridge and identify the seven nodes in this section of the bridge.
    2.  Assume that the bridge is concrete (the speed of sound in concrete is 3200 m/s). What is the lowest frequency of vibration for the bridge? (You can assume that the towers are equally spaced, and that the central support is equidistant from both middle towers. The best way to approach this problem is by drawing in a wave that “works.”)
    3.  What might happen if an earthquake occurs that shakes the bridge at precisely this frequency?
    
    ![0](media/15.png)
    
    \[Figure 13\]
27. Aborigines, the native people of Australia, play an instrument called the Didgeridoo like the one shown above. The Didgeridoo produces a low pitch sound and is possibly the world’s oldest instrument. The one shown above is about 1.3 m long and open at both ends.
    1.  Knowing that when a tube is open at both ends there must be an antinode at both ends, draw the first 3 harmonics for this instrument.
    2.  Calculate the frequency of the first 3 harmonics assuming room temperature and thus a velocity of sound of 340 m/s. Then take a shot at deriving a generic formula for the frequency of the $n$th standing wave mode for the Didgeridoo, as was done for the string tied at both ends and for the tube open at one end.
28. At the Sunday drum circle in Golden Gate Park, an Indian princess is striking her drum at a frequency of 2 Hz. You would like to hit your drum at another frequency, so that the sound of your drum and the sound of her drum “beat” together at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. What frequencies could you choose?
29. Students are doing an experiment to determine the speed of sound in air. They hold a tuning fork above a large empty graduated cylinder and try to create resonance. The air column in the graduated cylinder can be adjusted by putting water in it. At a certain point for each tuning fork a clear resonance point is heard. The students adjust the water finely to get the peak resonance then carefully measure the air column from water to top of air column. (The assumption is that the tuning fork itself creates an anti-node and the water creates a node.) The following data were collected:

| **Frequency of tuning fork (Hz)** | **Length of air column (cm)** | **Wavelength (m)** | **Speed of sound (m/s)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 184 | 46  |     |     |
| 328 | 26  |     |     |
| 384 | 22  |     |     |
| 512 | 16  |     |     |
| 1024 | 24  |     |     |

29. 1.  Fill out the last two columns in the data table.
    2.  Explain major inconsistencies in the data or results.
    3.  The graduated cylinder is 50 cm high. Were there other resonance points that could have been heard? If so what would be the length of the wavelength?
    4.  What are the inherent errors in this experiment?
30. A train, moving at some speed lower than the speed of sound, is equipped with a gun. The gun shoots a bullet forward at precisely the speed of sound, relative to the train. An observer watches some distance down the tracks, with the bullet headed towards him. Will the observer hear the sound of the bullet being fired before being struck by the bullet? Explain.
31. Peter is playing tones by blowing across the top of a glass bottle partially filled with water. He notices that if he blows softly he hears a lower note, but if he blows harder he hears higher frequencies. 
    1.  In the 120 cm long tubes below draw three diagrams showing the first three harmonics produced in the tube. Please draw the waves as transverse even though we know sound waves are longitudinal (reason for this, obviously, is that it is much easier to draw transverse waves rather than longitudinal). Note that the tube is CLOSED at one end and OPEN at the other. ![0](media/16.png)\[Figure 14\] 
    2.  Calculate the frequencies of the first three harmonics played in this tube, if the speed of sound in the tube is 340 m/s. 
    3.  The speed of sound in carbon dioxide is lower than in air. If the bottle contained CO<sub>2</sub> instead of air, would the frequencies found above be higher or lower? Knowing that the pitch of your voice gets higher when you inhale helium, what can we say about the speed of sound in He.

## 3.0 Basic Physics SE-Light Nature

<article>

![0](media/17.png "Figure 1: **PART I: Nature of Light, Polarization, Color**")

**The Big Idea**

Light is a _wave_ of changing electric and magnetic fields. Light waves are caused by disturbances in the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, for example, the acceleration of charged particles (such as electrons). Light has a dual nature: at times, it acts like waves; at other times it acts like particles, called _photons_. Light travels through space at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics, called the speed of light. Light has no mass, but it carries energy and momentum. Of all possible paths _light rays will always take the path that takes the least amount of time_ (not distance). This is known as Fermat’s Principle.

Light, more generally known as Electromagnetic Waves (EM Waves), can be produced in many different wavelengths that can be very large to extremely small. EM waves can be polarized when produced or after going through a filter (natural or man-made). Polarization of light, means that the light wave oscillates in only one direction rather than unpolarized light that oscillates in two directions as it moves forward.

The visible range of light (i.e. the range of wavelengths that our eyes can detect) is a very narrow piece of the full EM spectrum. In the visible range our eyes differentiate between the different wavelengths by producing ‘color’ for them. When we observe something that is green, it is green to us, because the wavelength of the light hitting our eyes is around 550 nm. If the wavelength of light is slightly larger than this it starts to look red, if it is slightly smaller it looks blue. White light is the combination of all the colors. Black light is the absence of EM waves in the visible spectrum for human beings.

**Key Concepts**

* Light is produced when charged particles _accelerate_. As a result changing electric and magnetic fields radiate outward. The traveling electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often oscillating) charged particle are known as electromagnetic radiation or light.
* The color of light that we observe is nothing more than the wavelength of the light: the _longer_ the wavelength, the _redder_ the light.
* Light can have any wavelength at all. Our _vision_ is restricted to a very narrow range of colors between red and violet.
* The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into the following ranges:

| **_Color_** | **_Wavelength range_** | **_Comparison size_** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gamma-ray ($\gamma$ - ray) | $10 ^{- 11} \ m$ and shorter | atomic nucleus |
| $x$\-ray | $10^{-11} \ m - 10^{-8} \ m$ | hydrogen atom |
| ultraviolet (UV) | $10^{-8} \ m - 10^{-7} \ m$ | small molecule |
| violet (visible) | $\sim 4 \times 10^{-7} \ m \ (400 \ nm)^*$ | typical molecule |
| blue (visible) | $\sim 450 \ nm$ | typical molecule |
| green (visible) | $\sim 500 \ nm$ | typical molecule |
| red (visible) | $\sim 650 \ nm$ | typical molecule |
| infrared (IR) | $10^{-6} \ m - 1 \ mm$ | human hair |
| microwave | $1 \ mm - 10 \ cm$ | human finger |
| radio | Larger than 10 cm | car antenna |

* The brightness, or **intensity**, of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the light source and the observer. This is just one of many **inverse square laws** in physics; others include gravitational and electrical forces.
* Fermat’s Principle makes the angle of incident light equal to the angle of reflected light. This is the _law of reflection_.
* When light travels from one type of material (like air) into another (like glass), the speed changes due to interactions between photons and electrons. **Transparent** materials transmit the electromagnetic energy at a speed slower than $c$; **opaque** materials absorb that EM energy and convert it into heat. A material may be transparent to some wavelengths of light but opaque to others.
* **Polarized** light is made of waves oscillating in only one direction: horizontal or vertical. The direction of the oscillation of the light waves is the same as the direction of oscillation of the electron _creating_ the light. Unpolarized light can be polarized selectively by reflections from surfaces (glare); the orientation of the reflected light polarization is the same as that of the surface.
* White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Our perception of the color black is tied to the _absence_ of light.
* Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells. The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our perception of other colors is made from the _relative amounts_ of each color that the cones register from light reflected from the object we are looking at. Our brightness-sensitive cells (rods) work well in low light. This is why things look ‘black and white’ at night.
* The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes – like those in a colorful shirt – absorb light at frequencies that correspond to certain colors. When you shine white light on these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected. We only see the colors that objects _reflect_.

Color Addition

![0](media/18.png "Figure 2: | **_Red_** | **_Green_** | **_Blue_** | **_Perceived color_** |")
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | white |
|     |     |     | black |
| $\checkmark$ |     | $\checkmark$ | magenta |
| $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |     | yellow |
|     | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ | cyan |

**Key Applications**

* _Rayleigh scattering_ occurs when light interacts with our atmosphere. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more strongly it is disturbed by collisions with atmospheric molecules. So blue light from the Sun is preferentially _scattered_ by these collisions into our line of sight. This is why the sky appears blue.
* _Beautiful sunsets_ occur when light travels long distances through the atmosphere. The blue light and some green is scattered away, leaving only red and a little green, making the sun appear red.

**Key Equations**

* $c = \lambda f$ ; The product of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the light (in meters) and the frequency $f$ of the light (in Hz, or $\frac{1}{sec}$) is always equal to a constant, namely the speed of light $c = 300,000,000 \ m/s$.

**Light Questions**

1.  Which travels faster - a radio wave or a sound wave? What’s the fundamental difference between the two? (bonus: name another fundamental difference between the two)
2.  Light does not travel infinitely fast – its speed in a vacuum is $3 \times 10^8 \ m/s$. We measure very large astronomical distances in “light years” (LY) – the distance light travels in one year. The closest star beyond our sun is Alpha Centauri, 4 LY away. Some distant quasars are 2 billion LY away. Why do astronomers say that to look at these distant objects is to look back in time? Explain briefly.
3.  When light impinges upon an object three things can happen to it: absorption, transmission, or reflection. Discuss an example of each.
4.  Which corresponds to light of longer wavelength, UV rays or IR rays?
5.  Which corresponds to light of lower frequency, $x-$rays or millimeter-wavelength light?
6.  Approximately how many blue wavelengths would fit end-to-end within a space of one millimeter?
7.  Approximately how many short (“hard”) $x-$rays would fit end-to-end within the space of a single red wavelength?
8.  Calculate the frequency in Hz of a typical green photon emitted by the Sun. What is the physical interpretation of this (very high) frequency? (That is, what is oscillating)?
9.  FM radio stations list the frequency of the light they are emitting in MHz, or millions of cycles per second. For instance, 90.3 FM would operate at a frequency of $90.3 \times 10^6 \ Hz$. What is the wavelength of the radio-frequency light emitted by this radio station? Compare this length to the size of your car’s antenna, and make an argument as to why the length of a car’s antenna should be about the wavelength of the light you are receiving.
10. Our sun is 8 “light minutes” from earth.
    1.  Using the speed of light as $c$ calculate the earth-sun distance in $m$, then convert it to miles (one mile = 1609 m)
    2.  The nearest galaxy to our Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, 2 million light years away. How far away is the Andromeda Galaxy in miles?
11. Consult the color table for human perception under the ‘Key Concepts’ section and answer the questions which follow.

    2.  Which secondary color would look black under a blue light bulb?
    3.  You look at a cyan-colored ribbon under white light. Which of the three primary colors is your eye _not_ detecting?
12. The **primary** colors of light are red, green, and blue. This is due to the way our eyes see color and the chemical reactions in the cone cells of the retina. Mixing these colors will produce the **secondary**, or complementary colors: magenta, cyan and yellow, as well as white. On the diagram below label colors to show how this works: ![0](media/19.png)\[Figure 3\]
13. Color printers use a different method of color mixing: color mixing by **subtraction**. What colors are used in this process? (HINT: look at the ink colors in an ink-jet printer, CYMB). The idea here is that each color **subtracts** from the reflected light – for example, cyan ink reflects blue and green but SUBTRACTS red. If Explain with diagrams how CYM can be combined to produce red, blue, and green.
14. Answer the following light transmission questions
    1.  A beam of cyan light passes into a yellow filter. What color emerges?
    2.  A beam of yellow light passes into a magenta filter. What color emerges?
    3.  What color results when two beams of light, one cyan and one magenta, are made to overlap on a white screen?
    4.  White light passes through a cyan filter followed by a magenta filter. What color emerges?
15. Describe the function of the dye in blue jeans. What does the dye do to each of the various colors of visible light?
16. Why is the sky blue? Find a family member who doesn’t know why the sky is blue and explain it to them. Ask them to write a short paragraph explaining the situation and include a sketch. ![0](media/20.png)\[Figure 4\]
17. Above is a graph of wavelength vs. intensity for sunlight reaching Earth.
    1.  Why does less light reach Earth’s surface than the top of the atmosphere?
    2.  Calculate the frequency of the most abundant light reaching the top of the atmosphere.
    3.  Which color of light is removed most in the atmosphere? How does this explain why the sky is the color it is? Explain this phenomenon with respect to the composition of the atmosphere.
18. Ocean water appears cyan because the microbes in the water preferentially absorb red light. What color does a red lobster appear on the ocean floor? How about a white shirt with blue stripes?
19. Explain how you could tell whether or not the light from a plasma screen TV is polarized.
20. A radio wave is emitted and bounces off some object, and returns in a total of $5.5 \ \mu s$. How far away is the object?
21. Here on Earth you can run a solar calculator using a solar panel about $1 \ cm \times 2 \ cm$. Suppose you take your calculator to Neptune, 30 AU from the sun. (The earth-sun distance is defined as 1 AU, or _astronomical unit_).
    1.  What fraction of sunlight intensity hits your solar panel at Neptune compared with at Earth?
    2.  Design a solar panel (size) that would allow you to collect the same amount of solar power (same amount of light energy in same time) on Neptune as on Earth.
22. You are reading two feet from a lamp with a 100 W (100 Watts) light bulb. For this problem, assume that a 100 W bulb is exactly half as bright as a 200 W bulb and that 50 W is half as bright as the 100 W bulb.
    1.  If you move 100 feet away from the lamp, how many 100-watt bulbs would you need to get the same amount of light to read as you had before?
    2.  Suppose you are reading 5 feet from a lamp with a 50 W bulb – it burns out and someone replaces the bulb with a 200-watt bulb. How far away from the lamp will you need to sit now to get the same amount of light?
23. A cell phone has an average power output of 1 watt, and you hold it about a cm from your brain. A strong TV signal from a transmitter like Sutro Tower has a power output of 1 million watts. Remembering the inverse-square law, how far could you stand from Sutro Tower to receive the same rate of radiation as from a cell phone? Express your answer in meters and in feet.
24. How do we know the universe is expanding? (hint: what is meant by ‘redshift’)
25. Explain why polarized sunglasses are often used by skiers, boaters, drivers, etc. Which way would the lenses be polarized? Draw a diagram to illustrate your answer.
26. Polarized filters block 50% of unpolarized light. If two filters are oriented so that their polarization axes are aligned, how much light is transmitted? What about if their axes are oriented perpendicular to each other? Draw two diagrams below to support your answers.

## 4.0 Basic Physics SE-Optics

<article>

![0](media/21.png "Figure 1: **PART II: Reflection, Refraction, Mirrors and Lenses**")

**The Big Idea**

Fermat’s Principle states that _light will always take the path of least amount of time_ (not distance). This principle governs the paths light will take and explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction, lenses and diffraction. Light rarely travels in a straight-line path. When photons interact with electrons in matter the time it takes for this interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency blue light is refracted more than red because blue wavelengths interacts more frequently with electrons than red wavelengths and the path of least time is for blue to bend more then red in order to get out of this ‘slow’ area faster. The rainbows we see are a result of this. Fermat’s Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows to sunsets to the haloes around the moon.

**Key Concepts**

* Fermat’s Principle makes the angle of incident light equal to the angle of reflected light. This is the _law of reflection_.
* When light travels from one type of material (like air) into another (like glass), the speed slows down due to interactions between photons and electrons. If the ray enters the material at an angle Fermat’s Principle dictates that the light also changes the direction of its motion. This is called _refraction_. See the figure shown to the right, which demonstrates the refraction a light ray experiences as it passes from air into a rectangular piece of glass and out again. Because light travels at slower than usual speed in transparent materials (due to constantly being absorbed and re-emitted), the light ray bends in order to get out of this material quicker and satisfy Fermat’s Principle. Note that this means that light doesn’t always travel in a straight line.

![0](media/22.png "Figure 2: * When light is refracted its _wavelength_ and _speed_ change; however, its frequency remains the same as the frequency of the light source. Proof of this is that light retains its original color under water. For example, blue light is still blue under water.")

**Key Applications**

* _Total internal reflection_ occurs when light goes from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low index of refraction) medium. With total internal reflection, light refracts _so_ much it actually refracts back into the first medium. This is how fiber optic cables work: no light leaves the wire.

![0](media/23.png "Figure 3: * _Lenses_, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light are called _converging_ lenses, and these are the ones used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light are called _diverging_ lenses.")
* Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called _images_.
* _Mirrors_ are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging mirrors can be used to focus light – headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely on this principle. Like lenses, mirrors can create images.
* The _focal length_, $f$, of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is called the _focal point_ or _focus_. For diverging lenses or mirrors, the focal length is negative.
* When light rays converge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a _real_ image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a photograph.

![0](media/24.png "Figure 4: * When light rays diverge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a _virtual_ image is formed. A virtual image is a trick, like the person you see “behind” a mirror’s surface when you brush your teeth. Since virtual images aren’t actually “anywhere,” you can’t place photographic film anywhere to capture them.")
* Real images are upside-down, or _inverted_. You can make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal length.
* When using the lens makers equation, remember that real things get positive numbers and virtual things get negative numbers. Thus, diverging lenses and virtual images get negative numbers. The object distance is always positive.

**Key Equations**

* $c = \lambda f$ - The product of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the light (in meters) and the frequency $f$ of the light (in Hz, or $\frac{1}{sec}$) is always equal to a constant, namely the speed of light $c = 300,000,000 \ m/s$.
* $n = \frac{c}{v}$ - The index of refraction, $n$, is the ratio of the speed $c$ it travels in a vacuum to the slower speed it travels in a material. $n$ can depend slightly on wavelength.
* $n_i \sin(\theta_i) = n_r \sin(\theta_r)$

![0](media/25.png "Figure 5: * $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{d_0}+\frac{1}{d_i}$ - For lenses, the distance from the center of the lens to the focus is $f$. Focal lengths are positive for converging lens and negative for diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the object in question is $d_0$, where distances to the left of the lens are positive in sign. The distance from the center of the lens to the image is $d_i$. This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of the lens).")

For mirrors, the same equation holds! However, the object and image distances are both positive for real images formed to the left of the mirror. For virtual images formed to the right of the mirror, the image distance is negative.

**Light Problem Set**

1.  What’s the difference between **diffuse** reflection and **specular** reflection? The size of the irregularities on the surface of a material will affect how the light reflects. Do a little research online and diagram light reflecting from a) a rough asphalt road and b) the same road made smooth by filling in the bumps with water. Explain why this makes it difficult to drive at night in the rain.
2.  If you’re standing on the side of a lake spearfishing, do you aim **right at** the fish you’re trying to hit, **above** it, or **below** it? Explain and include a diagram. If you’re hitting the fish with a laser instead where would you aim?
3.  Consider the following table, which states the indices of refraction for a number of materials.

6.  In the “disappearing test tube” demo, a test tube filled with vegetable oil vanishes when placed in a beaker full of the same oil. How is this possible? Would a diamond tube filled with water and placed in water have the same effect?

10. The figure above is immersed in water. Draw the light ray as it enters the Gas medium through its exit back into the water medium at the bottom. Be very careful drawing your light rays, making sure that it is clear when (and by how much) the angle is increasing, when decreasing and when staying the same. You may want to calculate the refracted angles to check your light ray drawings.
11. Use your ruler to draw the path of the ray as it goes through the following stack of materials. At each boundary draw the normal line. ![0](media/27.png)\[Figure 7\]
12. Who can see whom in the plane mirror below? Draw the lines with a ruler to prove your results. ![0](media/28.png)\[Figure 8\]
13. Does the size of your image in a mirror **as seen by you** depend upon your distance from the mirror? Put another way, do you need a bigger mirror to see your entire face if you’re close to the mirror, but smaller if you’re far away? Try this after you shower: rub out a section of your bathroom mirror just large enough to contain your face. Then move closer, then farther away. What happens? Discuss briefly.
14. Marjan is looking at herself in a mirror (a normal flat mirror). Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her head, and that she stands 180 cm tall. Calculate the minimum length flat mirror that Marjan would need to see her body from eye level all the way down to her feet. Sketch at least 3 ray traces from her eyes showing the topmost, bottommost, and middle rays. _In the following six problems, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays for virtual images). It is best if you can use different colors for the three different ray tracings. When sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the extrapolated lines behind a mirror or in front of a lens in order to produce the virtual image. When comparing measured distances and heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10% are considered “good.” Use the following cheat sheet as your guide._ CONVERGING (CONCAVE) MIRRORS Ray #1: Leaves tip of candle, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects back through focus. Ray #2: Leaves tip, travels through focus, reflects back parallel to optic axis. Ray #3: Leaves tip, reflects off center of mirror with an angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence. DIVERGING (CONVEX) MIRRORS Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, reflects OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the OPPOSITE side as the candle. Ray #2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel to the optic axis. Ray #3: Leaves tip, heads straight for the mirror center, and reflects at an equal angle. CONVERGING (CONVEX) LENSES Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts and travels to through to focus. Ray #2: Leaves tip, travels through focus on same side, travels through lens, and exits lens parallel to optic axis on opposite side. Ray #3: Leaves tip, passes straight through center of lens and exits without bending. DIVERGING (CONCAVE) LENSES Ray #1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the SAME side as the candle. Ray #2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel from the lens. Ray #3: Leaves tip, passes straight through the center of lens and exits without bending.

## 5.0 Basic Physics SE-Motion

<article>

![0](media/39.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Speed represents how quickly an object is moving through space. Velocity is speed with a direction, making it a _vector_ quantity. If an object’s velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating. As we’ll see in the next chapters, understanding the acceleration of an object is the key to understanding its motion. We will assume constant acceleration throughout this chapter.

**Key Definitions**

Vectors

$x =$ position (m)

$\Delta x =$ displacement $= x_f - x_i$

$v =$ velocity (m/s)

$v_i =$ initial velocity

$v_f =$ final velocity

$\Delta v =$ change in velocity $= v_f - v_i$

$a =$ acceleration $(m/s^2)$

Scalars

$t =$ time (s)

$d =$ distance $(m) = | \Delta x_1 | + | \Delta x_2 | + \ldots$

$v =$ speed (m/s) $= | v |$

Symbols

$\Delta \text{(anything)} = \text{final value} - \text{initial value}$

**Key Equations**

* $v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
* $a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

_The Big Three_

* $\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2} at^2$ ; allows you to calculate the displacement at some time $t$.
* $\Delta v = at$ ; allows you to calculate the velocity after some time $t$.
* $v_f{^2} = v_i{^2} + 2a( \Delta x)$ ; a combination of previous two equations.

**Key Concepts**

* When you begin a problem, define a coordinate system. For positions, this is like a number line; for example, positive $(+x)$ positions can be to the right of the origin and negative $(-x)$ positions to the left of the origin.
* For velocity $v$ you might define positive as _moving to the right_ and negative as _moving to the left_. What would it mean to have a **positive position** and a **negative velocity?**
* For acceleration $a$, you might define positive as caused by a _force to the right_ and negative as _a force to the left_. What would it mean to have a **negative velocity** and a **positive acceleration?** Careful, positive acceleration does not always mean increasing speed!
* Be sure you understand the difference between average velocity (measured over a long period of time) and instantaneous velocity (measured at a single moment in time).
* Gravity near the Earth pulls an object downwards toward the surface of the Earth with an acceleration of $9.8 \ m/s^2 ( \approx 10 \ m/s^2)$. In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the same acceleration.
* _Deceleration_ is the term used when an object’s _speed_ is decreasing due to acceleration in the opposite direction of its velocity.
* If there is constant acceleration the graph $x$ vs. $t$ produces a parabola. The slope of the graph equals the instantaneous velocity. The slope of a $v$ vs. $t$ graph equals the acceleration.
* The **slope** of the graph $v$ vs. $t$ can be used to find **acceleration;** the **area** of the graph $v$ vs. $t$ can be used to find **displacement.** Welcome to calculus!
* At first, you might get frustrated trying to figure out which of the Big Three equations to use for a certain problem, but don’t worry, this comes with practice. Making a table that identifies the variables given in the problem and the variables you are looking for can sometimes help.

**Solved Examples**

**Example 1:** Pacific loggerhead sea turtles migrate over 7,500 miles (12,000 km) between nesting beaches in Japan and feeding grounds off the coast of Mexico. If the average speed of a loggerhead is about 45 km/day, how long does it take for it to complete a one-way migration?

_Question:_ $t = ?$ \[days\]

_Given:_ $d = 12,000 \ km$

${\;} \qquad v_{avg} = 45 \ km/day$

_Equation:_ $v_{avg} = \frac{d}{t}$ therefore $t = \frac{d}{v_{avg}}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $t = \frac{d}{v_{avg}} = \frac{12,000 \ km}{45 \ km/day} = 267 \ days$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{267 \ days}}$

**Example 2:** A Top Fuel dragster can accelerate from 0 to 100 mph (160 km/hr) in 0.8 seconds. What is the average acceleration in $m/s^2$?

_Question:_ $a_{avg} = ? \ [m/s^2]$

_Given:_ $v_i = 0 \ m/s$

 ${\;} \qquad \ \ v_f = 160 \ km/hr$

${\;} \qquad \ \quad t = 0.8 \ s$

_Equation:_ $a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v }{t}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ Step 1: Convert km/hr to m/s

$v_f = \left( 160 \frac{km}{hr} \right ) \left( \frac{1,000 \ m}{1 \ km} \right ) \left ( \frac{1 \ hr}{3,600 \ s} \right ) = 44.4 \ m/s$

Step 2: Solve for average acceleration:

$a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{44.4 \ m/s - 0 \ m/s}{0.8 \ s} = 56 \ m/s^2$

_Answer:_ $\boxed {\mathbf{56 \ m/s^2}}$ _Note that this is over_ $5 \frac{1}{2}$ _g’s!_

**Example 3:** While driving through Napa you observe a hot air balloon in the sky with tourists on board. One of the passengers accidentally drops a wine bottle and you note that it takes 2.3 seconds for it to reach the ground. (a) How high is the balloon? (b) What was the wine bottle’s velocity just before it hit the ground?

_Question_ **_a_**_:_ $h = ? [m]$

_Given:_ $t = 2.3 \ s$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10 \ m/s^2$

${\;} \qquad \quad v_i = 0 \ m/s$

_Equation:_ $\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ or $h = v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $h = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(10 \ m/s^2)(2.3 \ s)^2 = 26.5 \ m$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{26.5 \ m}}$

_Question_ **_b_**_:_ $v_f = ? [m/s]$

_Given: (same as above)_

_Equation:_ $v_f = v_i + at$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $v_f = v_i +at = 0 + (10 \ m/s^2)(2.3 \ s) = 23 \ m/s$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{23 \ m/s}}$

**Example 4:** The second tallest building in the world is the Petronas Tower in Malaysia. If you were to drop a penny from the roof which is 378.6 m (1242 ft) high, how long would it take to reach the ground? You may neglect air friction.

_Question:_ $t = ? [s]$

_Given:_ $h = 378.6 \ m$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10 \ m/s^2$

${\;} \qquad \quad v_i = 0 \ m/s$

_Equation:_ $\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ or $h = v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ since $v_i = 0$, the equation simplifies to $h = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ rearranging for the unknown variable, $t$, yields

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(378.6 \ m)}{10.0 \ m/s^2}} = 8.70 \ s$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{8.70 \ s}}$

## 6.0 Basic Physics SE-Projectile Motion

<article>

![0](media/61.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

In this chapter, we aim to understand and explain the parabolic motion of a thrown object, known as projectile motion. Motion in one direction is unrelated to motion in other perpendicular directions. Once the object has been thrown, the only acceleration is in the $y$ (up/down) direction. The $x$ (right/left) direction velocity remains unchanged.

**Key Equations**

_In the vertical direction_

* $\Delta y = v_{iy} t - \frac{1}{2} gt^2$
* $\Delta v_y = - gt$
* $v_{y}{^2} = v_{iy}{^2} - 2g(\Delta y)$
* $a_y = -g = -9.806 \ m/s^2 \approx -10 \ m/s^2$

_In the horizontal direction_

* $\Delta x = v_{ix}t$
* $v_x = v_{ix}$ (does not change)
* $a_x = 0$

_A few comments on the above equations:_

* Recall: The ‘$\Delta$’ symbol means ‘change in’ so that for example $\Delta v_y = v_{fy} - v_{iy}$, which tells you the change in the velocity from the starting velocity to the final velocity.
* $+y$ direction is defined as upward for the above equations
* The initial velocity $v_i$ can be separated into $v_{ix} = v_i \cos \theta$ and $v_{iy} = v_i \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.

**Key Concepts**

* In projectile motion, the horizontal displacement of an object is called its _range_.
* At the top of its flight, the vertical speed of an object is zero.
* To work these problems, use the equations above: one set for the $y-$direction (vertical direction), and one set for the $x-$direction (horizontal direction). The $x-$direction and $y-$direction don’t “talk” to each other. They are separate dimensions. Keep them separate.
* The time is the same for the two directions, and can be plugged into both equations.
* Since in the absence of air resistance, there is no acceleration in the $x-$direction, the velocity in the $x-$direction does not change over time. This is a counter-intuitive notion for many. (Air resistance will cause the $x-$velocity to decrease slightly or significantly depending on the object. But this factor is ignored for the time being.)
* The $y-$direction motion must include the acceleration due to gravity, and therefore the velocity in the $y-$direction changes over time.
* The shape of the path of an object undergoing projectile motion is a parabola.
* We will ignore air resistance in this chapter. Air resistance will tend to shorten the range of the projectile motion by virtue of producing an acceleration opposite to the direction of motion.

**Solved Examples**

**Example 1:** A tennis ball is launched $32^\circ$ above the horizontal at a speed of 7.0 m/s. What are the horizontal and vertical velocity components?

_Question:_ $v_x$ and $v_y = \ ? \ [m/s]$

_Given:_ $v = 7.0 \ m/s$

${\;} \qquad \quad \theta = 32^\circ$

_Equation:_ $v_x = v \cos \theta \qquad v_y = v \sin \theta$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $v_x = v \cos \theta = (7.0 \ m/s) \cos (32^\circ)=5.9 \ m/s$

${\;}\qquad \qquad \qquad \ v_y = v \sin \theta = (7.0 \ m/s) \sin (32^\circ)= 3.7 \ m/s$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{5.9 \ m/s, 3.7 \ m/s.}}$

**Example 2:** CSI discovers a car at the bottom of a 72 m cliff. How fast was the car going if it landed 22m horizontally from the cliff’s edge? (Note that the cliff is flat, i.e. the car came off the cliff horizontally).

_Question:_ $v = \ ? \ [m/s]$

_Given:_ $h = \Delta y = 72 \ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad d = \Delta x = 22 \ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad g = 10.0 \ m/s^2$

_Equation:_ $h = v_{iy} t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ and $d = v_{ix} t$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ Step 1: Calculate the time required for the car to freefall from a height of 72 m.

$h = v_{iy} t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ but since $v_{iy}=0$, the equation simplifies to $h = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$ rearranging for the unknown variable, $t$, yields

$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(72 \ m)}{10.0 \ m/s^2}} = 3.79 \ s$

Step 2: Solve for initial velocity:

$v_{ix} = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{22 \ m}{3.79 \ s} = 5.80 \ m/s$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{5.80 \ m/s}}$

**Two-Dimensional and Projectile Motion Problem Set**

_Draw detailed pictures for each problem (putting in all the data, such as initial velocity, time, etc.), and write down your questions when you get stuck._

1.  Determine which of the following is in projectile motion. Remember that “projectile motion” means that gravity is the only means of acceleration for the object after launch.
    1.  A jet airplane during takeoff
    2.  A baseball during a Barry Bonds home run
    3.  A spacecraft just after all the rockets turn off in Earth orbit
    4.  A basketball thrown towards a basket
    5.  A bullet shot out of a gun
    6.  An inter-continental ballistic missile
    7.  A package dropped out of an airplane as it ascends upward with constant speed
2.  Decide if each of the statements below is True or False. Then, explain your reasoning.
    1.  At a projectile’s highest point, its velocity is zero.
    2.  At a projectile’s highest point, its acceleration is zero.
    3.  The rate of change of the $x-$position is changing with time along the projectile path.
    4.  The rate of change of the $y-$position is changing with time along the projectile path.
    5.  Suppose that after 2 s, an object has traveled 2 m in the horizontal direction. If the object is in projectile motion, it must travel 2 m in the vertical direction as well.
    6.  Suppose a hunter fires his gun. Suppose as well that as the bullet flies out horizontally and undergoes projectile motion, the shell for the bullet falls directly downward. Then, the shell hits the ground before the bullet.
3.  Imagine the path of a soccer ball in projectile motion. Which of the following is true at the highest point in its flight?
    1.  $v_x = 0, v_y = 0, a_x = 0,$ and $a_y = 0$
    2.  $v_x > 0, v_y = 0, a_x = 0,$ and $a_y = 0$
    3.  $v_x = 0, v_y = 0, a_x = 0,$ and $a_y = - 9.8 \ m/s^2$
    4.  $v_x > 0, v_y = 0, a_x = 0,$ and $a_y = - 9.8 \ m/s^2$
    5.  $v_x = 0, v_y > 0, a_x = 0,$ and $a_y = - 9.8 \ m/s^2$
4.  A hunter with an air blaster gun is preparing to shoot at a monkey hanging from a tree. He is pointing his gun directly at the monkey. The monkey’s got to think quickly! What is the monkey’s best chance to avoid being smacked by the rubber ball?
    1.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will pass beneath him due to gravity.
    2.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. Since the gun is pointing right at him, he can avoid getting hit by falling to the ground.
    3.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will sail above him since its vertical velocity increases by 9.8 m/s every second of flight.
    4.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. He will fall faster than the bullet due to his greater mass, and it will fly over his head.
5.  You are riding your bike in a straight line with a speed of 10 m/s. You accidentally drop your calculator out of your backpack from a height of 2.0 m above the ground. When it hits the ground, where is the calculator in relation to the position of your backpack?
    1.  You and your backpack are 6.3 m ahead of the calculator.
    2.  You and your backpack are directly above the calculator.
    3.  You and your backpack are 6.3 m behind the calculator.
    4.  None of the above.
6.  A ball of mass $m$ is moving horizontally with speed $v_o$ off a cliff of height $h$, as shown. How much time does it take the rock to travel from the edge of the cliff to the ground? ![0](media/62.png)\[Figure 2\]

13. A bird, traveling at 20 m/s, wants to hit a waiter 10 m below with his dropping (see image). In order to hit the waiter, the bird must release his dropping some distance before he is directly overhead. What is this distance? ![0](media/68.png)\[Figure 8\]
14. Joe Nedney of the _San Francisco 49ers_ kicked a field goal with an initial velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of $60^\circ$.
    1.  How long is the ball in the air? _Hint:_ you may assume that the ball lands at same height as it starts at.
    2.  What are the range and maximum height of the ball?
15. Vince Young throws a football. He throws it with an initial velocity of 30 m/s at an angle of $25^\circ$. How much time passes until the ball travels 35 m horizontally? What is the height of the ball after 0.5 seconds? (Assume that, when thrown, the ball is 2 m above the ground).
16. How long will it take a bullet fired from a cliff at an initial velocity of 700 m/s, at an angle $30^\circ$ below the horizontal, to reach the ground 200 m below? (hint: you’ll need to use quadratic equation in this one)

## 7.0 Basic Physics SE-Force

<article>

![0](media/71.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Acceleration is caused by force. The more force applied, the greater the acceleration that is produced. Objects with high masses have more inertia and thus resist more strongly changes to its current velocity. In the absence of applied forces, objects simply keep moving at whatever speed they are already going. All forces come in pairs because they arise in the interaction of two objects — you can’t hit without being hit back! In formal language$^1$:

_Newton’s $1^{st}$ Law: Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right_ (straight) _line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it._

_Newton’s $2^{nd}$ Law: The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right_ (straight) _line in which that force is impressed._

_Newton’s $3^{rd}$ Law: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts._

$^1$Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton, University of California Press, 1934

**Key Concepts**

* An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate) unless an unbalanced force acts on it. Equal and oppositely directed forces do not produce acceleration.
* If no unbalanced force acts on an object the object remains at constant velocity or at rest.
* The force of gravity is called weight and equals m**g**, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity of the planet ($g = 9.8 \ m/s^2 \sim 10 \ m/s^2$, downward, on Earth).
* Your mass does not change when you move to other planets, because mass is a measure of how much _matter_ your body contains, and not how much gravitational force you feel.
* Newton’s $3^{rd}$ Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult but very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: they must be of the same type of force, they are exerted on two different objects and they are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed. _Example:_ A block sits on a table. The Earth’s gravity on the block and the force of the table on the block are equal and opposite. **But these are not third law pairs,** because they are both on the same object and the forces are of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earth’s gravity on block/block’s gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on table.
* **Pressure** is often confused with force. Pressure is force spread out over an area; a small force exerted on a very small area can create a very large pressure; i.e., poke a pin into your arm!
* The force of **friction** can actually be described in terms of the _coefficient of friction,_ $\mu$. It is determined experimentally and varies depending upon the two surfaces in contact.
* **Static friction** acts between two surfaces that are in contact but not in motion with respect to each other. This force prevents objects from sliding. It always opposes potential motion, and it rises in magnitude to a maximum value given by the formula below.$^2$
* **Kinetic friction** acts between two surfaces that are in contact and in motion with respect to each other. This force reduces the acceleration and it always opposes the direction of motion.$^2$

$^2$Ultimately many of these “contact” forces are due to attractive and repulsive electromagnetic forces between atoms in materials.

**Key Equations**

* $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$ ; the acceleration produced depends on the net force on an object and its mass.

__or $F_{net} = \sum F_{\text{individual forces}} = ma$ ; the net force is the vector sum of all the forces__

$F_{net, y} = \sum F_{y- \text{direction forces}} = ma_y$ ; acting on the object.

* $F_g = mg$ ; the force of gravity acting on an object, often simply called the “weight” of the object. On Earth, $g = 9.8 \ m/s^2$ in the downward direction.
* $N$ or $F_N$ ; the normal force is a contact force that acts in a perpendicular direction to a surface.$^2$
* $T$ or $F_T$ ; the force of tension is a force that acts in strings, wires, ropes, and other non-stretchable lines of material.$^2$
* $f \le \mu F_N$ ; the force of friction acting between two surfaces, can be at rest $(\text{static friction,} \ f_s)$ or moving $(\text{kinetic friction}, f_k)^2$
* $P = \frac{F}{A}$ ; Pressure is a force exerted over some area

**Problem Solving for Newton’s Laws, Step-By-Step**

1. _Figure out which object is “of interest.”_

If you're looking for the motion of a rolling cart, the cart is the object of interest. Draw a sketch! This may help you sort out which object is which in your problem.

2. _Using your object as the “origin”, draw an $x-y$ coordinate system on your sketch._

This will help you properly place the directions of all your forces. Label to the right the $+x$ direction and up as the $+y$ direction. Label the mass.

3. _Identify all the forces acting on the object and draw them. This is called a free body diagram (FBD)._ **_LABEL_** _all forces – not with numbers, but with the symbol representing the force; i.e. $T$ is tension, mg is weight, $N$ is normal, etc. Be careful - If you can’t identify a force it may not really exist!_ INERTIA IS NOT A FORCE!

a. If the object has mass and is near the Earth, the easiest (and therefore first) force to write down is the force of gravity, pointing downward, with value _mg_.

b. If the object is in contact with a surface, it means there is a normal force acting on the object. This normal force points _away_ from and is perpendicular to the surface.

c. There may be more than one normal force acting on an object. For instance, if you have a bologna sandwich, remember that the slice of bologna feels normal forces from both the slices of bread!

d. If a rope, wire, or cord is pulling on the object in question, you've found yourself a tension force. The direction of this force is in the same direction that the rope is pulling (you can’t push on a rope!). Don’t worry about what’s on the OTHER end of the rope – it’s just “tension”.

e. Remember that Newton's 3rd Law, calling for “equal and opposite forces,” does not apply to a single object. Only include forces acting on the ONE object you have identified.

f. Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read out the normal force acting on you, not your weight. If you are at rest on the scale, the normal force equals your weight. If you are accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower than your weight, or you won’t have an unbalanced force to accelerate you.

g. Never include “m**a**” as a force acting on an object. “m**a**” is the _result_ for which the net force $F_{net}$ is the _cause._

4. _Identify which forces are in the $x-$direction, which are in the $y-$direction, and which are at an angle._

a. If a force is upward, make it in the $y-$direction and give it a positive sign. If it is downward, make it in the $y-$direction and give it a negative sign.

b. Same thing applies for right vs. left in the $x-$direction. Make rightward forces positive.

5. _“Fill in” to Newton’s second law:_



$$
\begin{align*}
& \quad \qquad \ \sum F_{\text{individual forces}}\qquad \ = ma. \\
& \qquad \text{or} \ \ \sum F_{x-\text{direction forces}}\quad \ \ = ma_x \\
& \qquad \qquad \nearrow \qquad \qquad  \qquad \qquad \qquad \  \nwarrow \\
& Add \ forces \ from \ diagram \qquad always \ ma \ on \ right \ side!
\end{align*}
$$

a. Remember that all the rightward forces add with a plus (+) sign, and that all the leftward forces add with a minus (–) sign.

b. Now repeat, but for the $y-$_forces_ and this will be equal to the mass multiplied by the acceleration in the $y-$direction.

**Solved Examples**

For Newton Law Problems, in addition to the ‘5-Step Process’, ALWAYS draw a Free-Body Diagram (FBD), before attempting to answer the question or solve the problem.

**Example 1:** A 175-g bluebird slams into a window with a force of 190 N. What is the bird’s acceleration?

![0](media/72.png "Figure 2: _Question:_ $a = ? [m/s^2]$")

_Given:_ $m = 175\ grams = 0.175\ kg$

${\;}\qquad \quad F = 19.0 \ N$

_Equation:_ $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \frac{19.0 \ N}{0.175 \ kg} = \frac{19.0 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}}{0.175\ kg} = 109 \frac{m}{s^2}$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{109 \ m/s^2}}$

**Example 2:** Calculate the acceleration of a rocket that has 500N of thrust force and a mass of 10kg.

![0](media/73.png "Figure 3: _Question:_ $a = ? [m/s^2]$")

_Given:_ $m = 10\ kg$

${\;} \qquad \quad F_{\text{thrust}} = 500\ N$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10.0\ m/s^2$

_Equations:_ $\sum F_{\text{individual forces}} = ma$

or, in this case, $\sum F_{y-\text{direction forces}} = ma_y$

_Plug_ _n_’ _Chug:_ Use FBD to “fill in” Newton’s second law equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
\sum F_{y-\text{direction forces}} &= ma_y \\
F - Mg & = Ma \\
500N - 10\ kg(10\ m/s^2) & = 10kg (a) \\
a & = 40\ m/s^2
\end{align*}
$$

**Example 3:** Calculate the force necessary to slide a 4.7-kg chair across a room at a constant speed if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the chair and the floor is 0.68.

![0](media/74.png "Figure 4: _Question:_ $F = ? [N]$")

_Given:_ $m = 4.7\ kg$

${\;}\qquad \quad \mu_k = 0.68$

${\;} \qquad \quad g = 10.0\ m/s^2$

_Equations:_ $\sum F = ma$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_y = N - mg = 0, \text{so}\ N = mg$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad \sum F_x = ma_x$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} - f_k = 0 \ (\text{because the chair is moving at}\ constant \ speed,\  \text{so}\ a=0)$

${\;}\qquad \ \qquad F_{\text{pull}} = \mu_k N$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ The force necessary to move the chair at a constant speed is equal to the frictional force between the chair and the floor. However in order to calculate the frictional force you must first determine the normal force which is (in this case) equal to the weight (i.e. $F_g$) of the chair.

$$
\begin{align*}
N & = mg = (4.7 \ kg)(10 \ m/s^2) = 47 \ N \\
F_{\text{pull}}  &= \mu_k \ N = (0.68)(47 \ N) = 32 \ N
\end{align*}
$$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{32 \ N}}$

**Example 4:** How much pressure does a 340-g Coke can exert on a table if the diameter of the can is 8.0 cm?

![0](media/75.png "Figure 5: _Question:_ $P = ? [Pa]$")

_Given:_ $m = 340\ grams = 0.340\ kg$

${\;}\qquad \quad \text{diameter} = 8.0\ cm = 0.08\ m$

${\;}\qquad \quad g = 10\ m/s^2$

_Equations:_ $P = \frac{F}{A}$ Area of a circle: $A = \pi \cdot r^2$

_Plug n’ Chug:_ $P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{ \pi \cdot r^2} = \frac{(0.340 \ kg)\left (10 \frac{m}{s^2} \right )}{\pi \left (\frac{0.08 \ m}{2} \right )^2}= \left (\frac{3.4 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}}{5.0 \times 10^{-3} m^2} \right ) = 680 \frac{N}{m^2} = 680 \ Pa$

_Answer:_ $\boxed{\mathbf{680 \ Pa}}$

## 8.0 Basic Physics SE-Momentum

<article>

![0](media/90.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe balances out … always. This law only makes sense if we measure “motion” in a specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called _momentum_, can be exchanged from one object to another in a collision. The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by the forces involved in the collision. Conservation of momentum is one of the five fundamental conservation laws in the universe. The other four are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge conservation and CPT conservation.

**Key Equations**

* $p = mv$ - Momentum equals mass multiplied by velocity. It is a vector, direction must be considered. Always define a positive direction and be consistent.
* $\Delta p = p_f - p_i$ - Impulse is defined as the difference between the final momentum and

the initial momentum of an object. When calculating impulse, consider the change in momentum of one of the objects in the collision.

* $F = \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t}$ - Note that $\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} =  \frac{m \Delta v}{\Delta t} = ma$. This is just Newton’s $2^{nd}$ Law!
* $\sum p_i = \sum p_f$ - The sum of all the momenta before a collision equals the sum of all the momenta after the collision. When adding up momenta, be sure to add them as vectors, so include the positives and negatives and if a two dimensional collision, break into the x and y components. Also be sure to include all the objects in the system.

**Key Concepts**

* Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the velocity vector. The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass and speed.
* The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal to zero. The total momentum of an isolated system never changes.
* Momentum can be transferred from one body to another. In an isolated system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum.
* Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision.
* The force imparted on an object is equal to the change in momentum divided by the time interval over which the objects are in contact.

**Key Applications**

* Two cars collide head-on … two subatomic particles collide in an accelerator … a bird slams into a glass office building: all of these are examples of one-dimensional (straight line) collisions. For these, pay extra attention to direction: define one direction as positive and the other as negative, and be sure everybody gets the right sign.
* A firecracker in mid-air explodes … two children push off each other on roller skates … an atomic nucleus breaks apart during a radioactive decay: all of these are examples of _disintegration_ problems. The initial momentum beforehand is zero, so the final momentum afterwards must also be zero.
* A spacecraft burns off momentum by colliding with air molecules as it descends … hail stones pummel the top of your car … a wet rag is thrown at and sticks to the wall: all of these are examples of _impulse_ problems, where the change in momentum of one object and the reaction to the applied force are considered. What is important here is the rate: you need to come up with an average time $\triangle t$ that the collision(s) last so that you can figure out the force $F = \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t}$. Remember as well that if a particle has momentum $p$, and it experiences an impulse that turns it around completely, with new momentum $-p$, then the total change in momentum has magnitude $2p$. It is harder to turn something totally around than just to stop it!
* A car going south collides with a second car going east … an inflatable ball is thrown into the flow of a waterfall … a billiard ball strikes two others, sending all three off in new directions: these are all examples of two-dimensional (planar) collisions. For these, you get a break: the sum of all the momenta in the $x$ direction have to remain unchanged before and after the collision — _independent_ of any $y$ momenta, and vice-versa. This is a similar concept to the one we used in projectile motion. Motions in different directions are independent of each other.

## 9.0 Basic Physics SE-Energy

<article>

![0](media/100.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Energy is a measure of the amount of or potential for movement in something. The total amount of energy in the universe is always the same. This symmetry is called a conservation law. Conservation of energy is one of five conservation laws that govern our universe. A group of things (we’ll use the word _system_) has a certain amount of energy. Energy can be added to a system; for instance, when chemical bonds in a burning log break, they release heat. Energy can be lost from a system; for instance, when a spacecraft “burns up” its energy of motion during re-entry, it loses energy and the surrounding atmosphere gains the lost energy. A _closed_ system is one for which the total energy does not change, or is _conserved_. In this chapter, we will often consider closed systems, for which the total amount of energy stays the same, but transforms from one kind to another. The transfer of energy from one system to another is called _Work_. Work is equal to the amount of energy transferred _in_ (positive work) or _out_ (negative work) of a system. Work is equal to the distance the object is moved multiplied by the amount of force in the direction of its motion. The _rate_ at which work is done is called _Power_.

**Key Definitions**

* $m =$ mass (in kilograms, kg)
* $h =$ height above the ground (in meters, m)
* $v =$ speed (in meters per second, m/s)
* $g =$ acceleration due to gravity $(9.8 \ m/s^2 \approx 10 \ m/s^2)$
* $E =$ energy (in Joules; $1 \ J = 1 \ kg \cdot m^2/ \text{s}^2$)
* $W =$ work (in Joules; work is just energy being transferred)
* $P =$ power (in Watts; $1 \ W = 1 \ J/s$)

**Key Equations**

* $\sum E_{\text{initial}} = \sum E_\text{final}$ ; The total energy does not change in closed systems
* $KE = \frac{1}{2} \ mv^2$ ; Kinetic energy
* $PE_g = mgh$ ; Potential energy of gravity
* $PE_{sp} = \frac{1}{2} \ kx^2$ ; Potential energy of a spring
* $W = F_{x} \Delta x = Fd \ \cos \circleddash$ ; Work is equal to the distance multiplied by the component of the force in the direction it is moving.
* $P = W/t$ ; Power is equal to the energy released per second
* $Eff = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$ ; The efficiency equals the output power divided by the input power

**Key Concepts**

* The energy of motion is kinetic energy, KE. Whenever an object is in motion it has kinetic energy. The faster it is going, the more energy it has.
* The energy due to gravity is called gravitational potential energy, $PE_g$, which gets larger the farther off the ground you are.
* Molecules have chemical potential energy due to the bonds between the electrons; when these bonds are broken, energy is released which can be transferred into kinetic and/or potential energy. 1 food Calorie (1 _kilocalorie_) is equal to 4180 Joules of stored chemical potential energy.
* Energy can be transformed from one kind into the other; if the total energy at the end of the process appears to be less than at the beginning, the “lost” energy has been transferred to another system, often by heat or sound waves.
* Work is simply the word for the amount of energy transferred in or out of the system. Work can be computed by multiplying the distance with the component of force that is parallel to the distance
* Efficiency is equal to the output energy divided by the input energy.

**Key Applications**

* Work is defined as the product of a force times the distance over which the force acts. The force and the distance must act along the same line; if the angle between them is not $0^\circ$ (or $180^\circ$) then you must use the component of force; hence the $\cos \circleddash$ in the equation.
* Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with great force while utilizing only a little force. The trade-off is that you must operate the smaller input force for a large distance. This is all seen through the work Equation. Work equals force times distance. Energy is conserved. Thus one can get a large force for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance.
* Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the distance the object moves. It is also equal to the output force divided by the input force.
* In “roller coaster” problems, the gravitational potential energy at the top of one hill turns into kinetic energy at the bottom of the next valley. It turns back into potential energy as you round the next hill, and so on. However, some of the energy is lost to the tracks and air as heat, which is why the second rise is often not as big as the first.
* When we say energy is lost as heat, often what we mean is that a friction force does _negative_ work on an object. That negative work is lost energy - heat. Keep in mind that work is force times distance.
* In “pendulum” problems, the potential energy at the highest point in a pendulum’s swing changes to kinetic energy when it reaches the bottom and then back into potential energy when it reaches the top again. At any in-between point there is a combination of kinetic energy and potential energy, but the total energy remains the same.
* In everyday life, the human body breaks down the food molecules to change some of the bonding energy into energy that is used to power the body. This energy goes on to turn into kinetic energy as a person moves, or for example an athlete gains speed. The kinetic energy can be changed into potential energy as a person gains height above the ground.

## 10.0 Basic Physics SE-Heat

<article>

![0](media/110.png "Figure 1: **The Big Ideas**")

Heat is a form of energy transfer. Materials do not contain heat. They contain internal energy that can be transferred (i.e. heat) from one body to another. Internal energy is the vibrating and rotating and general jostling of atoms and/or molecules that make up the ‘thing,’ whether it is wood, steel, water. One way to measure the heat of an object is to measure its temperature. This is really a statement about its internal kinetic energy.

Heat expansion is a result of the increase of kinetic energy of the molecules. As their movement increases, they bump into each other more and the material slightly expands as a result. Most materials expand with heat. Water is a particularly interesting substance in that it _contracts_ as its temperature increases from $0^\circ C$ to $4^\circ C$ (and then expands from $4^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$).

Heat can be transferred in three ways, through conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat by physical contact. Heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. Convection is heat transfer by an intermediate substance (for example air or water). Your oven (often properly called the ‘convection oven’) works by heating up the air and then the air heats up your food. Radiation is the release of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing electromagnetic waves. The hotter the object the higher the frequency of the light emitted. When you look at a fire the blue flames our hotter than the red flames because blue has a higher frequency than red.

Entropy is a measure of disorder, or the variety of ways in which a system can organize itself with the same total energy. The entropy of any isolated system always tends to disorder (i.e. entropy is always increasing). In the universe, the entropy of a subset (like evolution on Earth) can decrease (i.e. more order), but the total entropy of the universe is decreasing (i.e. more disorder).

**Key Concepts**

* When an object feels cold to the touch, it is because heat is flowing from you to the object.
* When an object feels hot to the touch, it is because heat is flowing from the object to you.
* Some objects (like metals) conduct heat better than others (like wood). Thus if you stick a metal rod in the fireplace and hold the other end, the heat is conducted well and you get burned. On the other hand, if you place a wood stick in the fire and hold the other end you’ll be OK.
* The temperature of a gas is a measure of the amount of average kinetic energy that the atoms in the gas possess.
* If you heat something, you increase its internal energy, so you increase the movement of molecules that make up this thing, thus it expands. This is called heat expansion; most everything expands as heated and contracts as cooled.
* Most materials expand as they are heated. This can cause bridges to collapse if they are not designed to have a place to expand in the summer months (like the placing of metal ‘teeth’ at intervals on the Golden Gate Bridge).
* Water _contracts_ from $0^\circ C$ to $4^\circ C$ and then expands from $4^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$. Remembering that density is mass divided by volume explains why water at $4^\circ C$ is more dense than water below and above $4^\circ C$. This also explains why lakes freeze on the top first and not throughout. As the water on the top of the lake drops below $4^\circ C$, it is now more dense than the water below it, thus it sinks to the bottom, allowing the warmer water to rise up to the top and cool down in the winter weather. Only when the entirety of the lake is at $4^\circ C$, then the lake can start to freeze. It freezes from the top down, because water below $4^\circ C$ is less dense than water at $4^\circ C$.

![0](media/111.png "Figure 2: * There are 3 different temperature scales you should know-the Kelvin scale, the Celsius scale and the Fahrenheit scale.")
* The Kelvin scale (K) is the one used in most scientific equations and has its zero value set at _absolute zero_ (the theoretical point at which all motion stops).
* The Celsius scale $(^\circ C)$ is the standard SI temperature scale. It is equal to the Kelvin scale if you minus 273 from the Celsius reading. Water has a boiling point of $100^\circ C$ and a freezing point of $0^\circ C$.
* The Fahrenheit scale $(^\circ F)$ is the English system and the one we are familiar with.
* **Newtons’ Law of Cooling:** The rate of heat transfer is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two objects. For example, hot liquid that is put in the freezer will cool much faster than a room temperature liquid that is put in the same freezer.
* **Heat capacity** is the amount of internal energy that the substance can store. A large heat capacitance means the substance can store a lot of internal energy and thus the temperature changes slowly. Aluminum foil has a small heat capacitance and water has a large one.
* The amount of heat capacitance (and thus its specific heat value) is related to something called ‘degrees of freedom,’ which basically says how free is the object to move in different ways (and thus how much kinetic energy can it store inside itself without breaking apart). For example, solids have a more fixed structure, so they cannot rotate and jostle as much, so they can’t store as much internal energy so they have lower heat capacitance then liquids.
* **Specific heat** is similar to heat capacitance, but is a specific number. The specific heat tells you how much energy one must put in per unit mass in order to raise the temperature $1^\circ C$.
* **Phase changes**: it takes energy to changes phases from a solid to a liquid and from a liquid to a gas. The substance releases energy when changing phase from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. How much energy per unit mass depends on the substance in question. When you get out of the shower you often feel cold. This is because the water on you is evaporating, and heat is flowing from you to the water droplets in order for them to change phase from water to gas. You are losing heat and thus feel cold.

**Key Application**

* The human body radiates heat in the range of infrared light. Night goggles work by ‘seeing’ the infrared light emitted by our bodies.

![0](media/112.png "Figure 3: * The thermostat works with a bi-metallic strip. A bi-metallic strip is a flat rectangular object with two different metal strips glued together back to back. In the example above (courtesy of ‘hyperphysics’) we have brass and steel. Brass has a larger heat expansion than steel. When the temperature gets Hotter, the brass strip will expand more than the steel one and thus the strip will bend downward, triggering the thermostat to turn on the air conditioner. When the Temperature goes below the set value, then the brass one contracts more than the steel one and it bends upward. This triggers the heating to be turned on.")
* A calorie is a unit of energy. The food Calorie, with a capital $C$, is actually 1,000 calories (a kcal). Thus, for example, a snicker bar labeled with 200 Cal is actually 200,000 cal.
* Food calories are determined by burning the food and measuring the heat released.
* The human body is at a temperature that radiates away heat in the form of infrared wavelengths. Night goggles work by ‘seeing’ the infrared light and then converting it into visible light (the green screen you usually see in the movies is because the conversion is usually done with a phosphorous screen).
* For electronics in space, one must use very large heat sinks to radiate away the heat from components and chips like the processor. Since there is no air in space, a fan will not do anything. The processor chip cannot release heat built up by convection, so it must radiate it away over a large heat sink.
* More than 50% of the water rise expected from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of water (more on greenhouse effect below).

![0](media/113.png "Figure 4: **The Greenhouse Effect**")

**Greenhouse Effect:** The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

**Current Situation**: Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about $1.0 \ W/m^2$. Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).

**Possible Effects That Can Accelerate Global Warming:**

1.  **Time Lag:** The excess energy warms the ocean very slowly, due to water’s high heat capacity. Even in the unlikely event that no more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere the temperature increase already measured will be almost doubled.
2.  **The Effect of Water Vapor:** Increasing temperatures will lead to more evaporation and more water vapor in the atmosphere. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas and its increased presence may cause further warming in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand if the water vapor results in more clouds more solar radiation will be reflected, a possible negative feedback.
3.  **Albedo** is the amount of light reflected by a surface. Sea ice has an albedo of .85, meaning 85% of light is reflected back from its surface (and leaves the Earth) and 15% is absorbed and stays in the Earth; ice-free water has an albedo of .07. (93% of the solar energy is absorbed.) Thus the observed melting of sea ice could amplify the effect of global warming
4.  The **Melting of the Artic Permafrost** also has an amplifying effect by releasing carbon dioxide and methane that is normally trapped in the tundra.
5.  Warmer oceans are hostile to **algae and cytoplankton**, which are the most important absorbers of carbon dioxide. The loss of these two photosynthesizers would remove the most important natural $CO_2$ sink.
6.  **Loss of Rain Forests** would have a similar effect. Global warming is likely to lead to desertification of the habitats of rain forests. The rain forest is the second most important $CO_2$ sink.

**Key Equations**

* $T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32^\circ \text{F}$ ; conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit

* $T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32^\circ \text{F})$ ; conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius
* $Q = mc \Delta T$ ; the heat gained or lost is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its specific heat multiplied by the change of its temperature.
* $Q = mL$ ; the heat lost or gained by a substance due to a change in phase is equal to the mass of the substance multiplied by the heat of vaporization/fusion
* 1 cal = 4.184 Joules ; your food calorie is actually a kilocalorie (Cal) and equal to 4184 J.

## 11.0 Basic Physics SE-Circular Motion

<article>

![0](media/124.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line. If they turn — that is, if their velocity changes, _even only in direction_ — there must be an applied force. Forces which cause objects to turn around continuously in a circle are known as _centripetal_ forces. When an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant points in a direction _tangent_ to the circle. The acceleration points towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it. This is only natural, when you think about it — if you feel a force pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a circle, always turning left.

**Key Equations**

* $a_C = \frac{v^2}{r}$ ; the acceleration of an object moving at constant speed and going in a circle is equal to the square of its speed divided by the radius of the circle.
* $F_C = ma_C = \frac{mv^2}{r}$ ; if an object of mass $m$ moves in a circle of radius $r$ at speed $v$, the force acting on it must be equal to this value. The direction of this force is always pointed towards the center of the circle.

**Key Concepts**

![0](media/125.png "Figure 2: * Centripetal Force is an umbrella term that refers to any force that makes something move in a circle. Examples of forces that can be centripetal forces are as follows: _Gravity_ (the gravity between the Earth and Sun causes the Earth to go in a circle), _Friction_ (the friction force between a car’s tires and the road causes the car to turn), Tension (when swinging a bucket around in a circle by holding onto the string, the tension of the string is the centripetal force)")
* An object moving in a circle has an instantaneous velocity _tangential_ to the circle of its path. The force and acceleration point to the center of the circle.
* Net force and acceleration _always_ have the same direction.
* An orbital period, $T$, is the time it takes to make one complete rotation.
* If a particle travels a distance $2 \pi r$ in an amount of time $T$, then its speed is distance over time or $\frac{2 \pi r}{T}$.
* The centripetal force can by comprised of more than one force. For example, with roller coasters, the centripetal force at the top of a loop is the addition of the force of gravity and the normal force, both of which are acting on the rollercoaster and both pointing down from the top and, thus, towards the center of the circle. Note at the bottom of the loop, one would subtract the force of gravity from the normal force to find the centripetal force.
* Centripetal acceleration is just the acceleration provided by centripetal forces and can be found by dividing the centripetal force by the objects mass.

**Key Applications**

* To find the maximum speed that a car can take a corner on a flat road without skidding out, set the force of friction equal to the centripetal force.
* Banked turns (the road is not flat, but rather at an angle) allow for a greater speed before skidding out. In this case the normal force aids the force of friction in creating a larger centripetal force than that which can be obtained by friction alone on a flat road. It’s not as simple as adding them together, one must consider the components of these two forces in the direction to the center of the circle.

![0](media/126.png "Figure 3: * To find the tension in the rope of a swinging pendulum, remember that it is the _sum_ of the tension and gravity that produces a net upward centripetal force. A common mistake is just setting the centripetal force equal to the tension.")
* To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, realize that the force of gravity is the centripetal force. So set the force of gravity equal to $\frac{mv^2}{r}$, where $v$ is the speed of the planet, $m$ is the mass of the planet or satellite and $r$ is the distance of the planet to the sun or the satellite to the Earth.
* Some data needed for the problems:

__The radius of Earth is $6.38 \times 10^6 \ m$__

The Earth-Moon distance is about $3.84 \times 10^8 \ m$

## 12.0 Basic Physics SE-Gravity

<article>

![0](media/134.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

Over 2500 years ago Aristotle proposed two laws of physics governing motion. One for ‘Earthly bodies’ (objects on Earth) that states objects naturally go in straight lines and one for ‘Heavenly bodies’ (objects in space) that states objects naturally go in circles. This idea held steady for 2,000 years, until Isaac Newton in a triumph of brilliance declared that there is one law of physics that governs motion and he unified “earthly” bodies and “heavenly” bodies with the The Universal Law of Gravitation. Newton used the universal law of gravity to prove that the moon is accelerating towards Earth just as a body on Earth is falling towards Earth. The acceleration of both the moon and the object on Earth is calculated using the same formula. This theory is so well regarded that it has been used to hypothesize the existence of black holes and dark matter, later verified by observation. The search to unify the laws of physics into one theory continues today and is often referred to as the yet undiscovered Grand Unified Theory (GUT).

**Key Equation: The Universal Law of Gravity**

* $F_G =\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$ ; the force of gravity between an object with mass $m_1$ and another object of mass $m_2$ and a distance between them of $r$.
* $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \ Nm^2 /  kg^2$ ; the universal constant of gravity
* $g = \frac{Gm}{r^2}$ ; gravitational field strength or gravitational acceleration of a planet with mass $m$ and radius $r$. Note that this is not really a separate equation but comes from Newton’s second law and the law of universal gravitation.

**Key Concepts**

* When using the Universal Law of Gravity formula and the constant $G$ above, make sure to use units of meters and kilograms.
* Newton invented calculus in order to prove that for a spherical object (like Earth) one can assume all of its mass is at the center of the sphere (thus in his formula, one can use the radius of Earth for the distance between a falling rock and Earth).
* An orbital period, $T$, is the time it takes to make one complete rotation.
* If a particle travels a distance $2 \pi r$ in an amount of time $T$, then its speed is distance over time or $\frac{2 \pi r}{T}$.
* Objects in orbit around each other, orbit about the center of mass for the system. For the Earth and moon the center of mass is somewhere inside of Earth. So while the moon orbits Earth, the Earth also orbits the moon (manifested as a slight wobble).

**Key Applications**

* To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, realize that the force of gravity is the centripetal force. So set the force of gravity equal to $\frac{mv^2}{r}$, where $v$ is the speed of the planet, $m$ is the mass of the planet or satellite and $r$ is the distance of the planet to the sun or the satellite to the Earth.
* The Geo-synchronous orbit is that orbit for which the satellite takes the same amount of time to orbit the planet as the planet takes to make one revolution. For satellites to be over the same place of the planet at all times, it must be in a Geo-synchronous orbit.
* Some data needed for the problems:

__The radius of Earth is $6.4 \times 10^6 \ m$__

The Earth-Moon distance is about $3.8 \times 10^8 \ m$

**Gravity Problem Set**

1.  Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on the moon, or the force the moon exerts on the Earth? Why doesn’t the moon fall into the earth?
2.  Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Sun exerts on the moon, or the force the Earth exerts on the moon? Does the moon orbit the Earth or the Sun? Explain.
3.  Suppose you’re standing in an elevator on a bathroom scale. Draw a FBD for you and label the two forces acting on you. Describe how the scale reading compares to your weight when
    1.  The elevator is at rest
    2.  The elevator is moving up at a constant speed
    3.  The elevator is accelerating upward
    4.  The cable breaks and the elevator is in free fall
4.  Astronauts in orbit are not beyond the pull of earth’s gravity – in fact, gravity is what KEEPS them in orbit! So why are they “weightless”? Explain briefly.
5.  Use Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to explain why even though Jupiter has 300 times the mass of the earth, on the “surface” of Jupiter you’d weigh only 3 times what you weigh on earth. What other factor has to be considered here?
6.  Suppose we drilled a hole through the earth and dropped in a rock. How would the speed and acceleration of the rock vary as the rock falls into the earth? Would the rock come shooting out of the other side of the earth, or would it oscillate back and forth? Use a diagram in your explanation.
7.  There are basically three possible fates for a star that reaches the end of its life: white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. What’s the main factor that determines which one a star will become? Which will our sun become? Explain what a black hole is. You may have to do a little research for this one.
8.  Do some research online to answer this question: there are three huge pieces of evidence for the Big Bang. Two cosmological phenomena called _the cosmic microwave background radiation_ and _the expansion of the universe._ The third is called _nucleosynthesis._ Explain/define each, and briefly discuss how each supports the Big Bang theory. How do astronomers know the universe is expanding?
9.  Prove $g$ is _approximately_ $10 \ m/s^2$on Earth by following these steps:
    1.  Calculate the force of gravity between a falling object (for example an apple) and that of Earth. Use the symbol $m_o$ to represent the mass of the falling object.
    2.  Now divide that force by the object’s mass to find the acceleration $g$ of the object.
    3.  Calculate the force of gravity between the Sun and the Earth. (sun mass $= 2.0 \times 10^{30} \ kg;$ average distance from sun to earth = 150 million km)
10. Calculate the force of gravity between two human beings, assuming that each has a mass of 80 kg and that they are standing 1 m apart. Is this a large force?
11. What is the force of gravity between an electron and a proton? Do you think this is what keeps the electron ‘orbiting’ the proton in the hydrogen atom?
12. Calculate the gravitational force that your pencil or pen pulls on you. Use the center of your chest as the center of mass (and thus the mark for the distance measurement) and estimate all masses and distances.
    1.  If there were no other forces present, what would your acceleration be towards your pencil? Is this a large or small acceleration?
    2.  Why, in fact, doesn’t your pencil accelerate towards you?
13. Mo and Jo have been traveling through the galaxy for eons when they arrive at the planet Remulak. Wanting to measure the gravitational field strength of the planet they drop Mo’s lava lamp from the top deck of their spacecraft, collecting the velocity-time data shown below.

14. A neutron star has a mass of about 1.4 times the mass of our sun and is about 20 km in diameter. It’s the remains of a star several times more massive than our sun that has blown off its outer layers in a supernova explosion. (see #1 for mass of sun)

## 13.0 Basic Physics SE-Electrostatics

<article>

![0](media/136.png "Figure 1: **The Big Idea**")

_Conservation of charge_ is the fourth of the 5 conservation laws in physics. There are two charges, + and -, and the symmetry of the electric charge indicates that the total charge in the universe remains the same. In any closed system, charge can be transferred from one body to another but the amount of electric charge in the universe remains the same.

_Electromagnetism_ is associated with charge and is a fundamental force of nature like gravity. If charges are static (i.e. not moving) the electromagnetic force is the _Coulomb electric force_. In the same way that the gravitational force depends on mass, the Coulomb electric force depends on the property known as electric _charge_. Like gravity the Coulomb electric Force decreases with the square of the distance. The Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces discussed previously: the normal force, contact forces, friction, and so on… _all_ of these forces arise in the mutual attraction and repulsion of charged particles.

The law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb electric force has the same form as the law of gravity. The electric constant is 20 orders of magnitude greater than the gravitational constant. That is why electricity normally dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular level. However, gravity will dominate in large bodies. The reason is that atoms and molecules have equal number of positive and negative charges and are therefore electrically neutral (thus the Coulomb electric force is canceled out).

**Key Equations**

* $q = Ne$ ; the total charge of an object is always some integer $N$ multiplied by the fundamental charge $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ C$.
* $F = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$ ; the force exerted by two charges on one another depends on the amount of the charge, the distance between them, and a fundamental constant $k = 9 \times 10^9 Nm^2/C^2$.
* $F = qE$ ; a charged object in an electric field feels a force.
* $E = \frac{kq}{r^2}$ ; the electric field produced by a charged object depends on the charge of the object and the distance to the object. through a changing electric potential.
* $E = \frac{- \Delta V}{\Delta x}$ ; the electric field depends on how quickly the electric potential varies over space; alternatively $\Delta V = - E \cdot \Delta x$.
* $V = \frac{kq}{r}$ ; the electric potential produced by a charged object depends on the charge of the object and the distance to the object.

* In any process, electric charge is conserved. The total electric charge of the universe does not change. Therefore, electric charge can only be transferred – not lost – from one body to another.
* Electrons have negative charge and protons have positive charge. The magnitude of the charge is the same for both, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ C$.
* Normally, electric charge is transferred when electrons leave the outer orbits of the atoms of one body (leaving it positively charged) and move to the surface of another body (causing the new surface to gain a negative net charge). In a plasma all electrons are stripped from the atoms, leaving positively charged ions and free electrons.
* Similarly charged objects have a repulsive force between them. Oppositely charged objects have an attractive force between them.
* The value of the electric field tells you the force that a charged object would feel _if_ it entered this field. Electric field lines tell you the direction a positive charge would go if it were placed in the field.
* Electric potential is measured in units of Volts $(V)$ – thus electric potential is often referred to as “voltage.”
* Positive charges move towards lower electric potential; negative charges move toward higher electric potential

**Key Applications**

* In problems that ask for excess negative or positive charge, remember that each electron has one unit of the fundamental charge $e$.
* To find the speed of a particle after it traverses a voltage difference, use the equation for the conservation of energy: $q \Delta V = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
* Force and electric field are vectors and thus have direction as well as their value.
* Electric field lines point from high electric potential to low potential and are perpendicular to the electric potential line. Note that this agrees with the fact that electric field lines tell you the direction a positive charge would travel, since positive charges go from high potential (i.e. big voltage) to low potential (i.e. low voltage).

## 14.0 Basic Physics SE-DC Electric Circuits

<article>

![0](media/145.png "Figure 1: **The Big Ideas:**")

The name _electric current_ is the name given to the phenomenon that occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of light. _Voltage_ is the electrical energy density that causes the electric current. _Resistance_ is the amount a device in the wire resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other forms of energy. A device, the resistor, could be a light bulb, transferring electrical energy into heat and light or an electric motor that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in Voltage across a resistor or other electrical device is called the _voltage drop._

In electric _circuits_ (closed loops of wire with resistors and voltage sources) energy must be conserved. It follows that the algebraic sum of voltage drops and voltage sources, around any closed loop, will equal zero.

In an electric _junction_ there is more than one possible path for current to flow. For charge to be conserved at a junction the current into the junction must equal the current out of the junction.

**Key Equations:**

* $I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$ - current is the rate at which charge passes by; the units of current are Amperes $(1 \ A = 1 \ C/s)$.
* $\Delta V = I \cdot R$ - the current flow through a resistor depends on the applied electric potential difference across it; the units of resistance are Ohms $(1 \ \Omega = 1 \ V/A)$.
* $P = I \cdot \Delta V$ - the power dissipated by a resistor is the product of the current through the resistor and the applied electric potential difference across it; the units of power are Watts $(1 \ W = 1 \ J/s)$.
* $E = P \cdot t$ - the electrical energy used is equal to the power dissipated multiplied by the time the circuit is running

**Key Concepts:**

* **Ohm’s Law** $V=IR$ (Voltage drop equals current times resistance.) This is the main equation for electric circuits but it is often misused. In order to calculate the voltage drop across a light bulb use the formula: $V_{lightbulb} = I_{lightbulb}R_{lightbulb}$. For the _total_ current flowing out of the power source, you need the _total_ resistance of the circuit and the _total_ current: $V_{total} = I_{total}R_{total}$.
* **Power** is the rate that energy is released. The units for power are watts (W), which equal joules per second $[W] = [J]/[s]$. For example, a 60 W light bulb transforms 60 joules of electrical energy into light and heat energy every second.

The equation used to calculate the **power** dissipated in a circuit is $P=IV$. As with Ohm’s Law, one must be careful not to mix apples with oranges. If you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the _total_ voltage of the power source by the _total_ current coming out of the power source. If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a light bulb, then you multiply the _voltage drop_ across the light bulb by the _current going through that light bulb._

| **Name** | **Symbol** | **Electrical Symbol** | **Units** | **Water Analogy** | **Everyday device** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Voltage | $V$ | ![0](media/146.png)\[Figure 2. | volts $(V)$<br><br>$V=J/C$ | A water dam with pipes coming out at different heights. The lower the pipe along the dam wall, the larger the water pressure, thus the higher the voltage. | Battery, the plugs in your house, etc. |
| Current | $I$ |     | amps $(A)$<br><br>$A = C/s$ | A river of water. Objects connected in series are all on the same river, thus receive the same current. Objects connected in parallel make the main river branch into smaller rivers. These guys all have different currents. | Whatever you plug into your wall sockets draws current |
| Resistance | $R$ | ![0](media/147.png)<br><br>\[Figure 3\]<br><br>\_\_\_\_\_ | ohms $(\Omega)$ | If current is analogous to a river, then resistance is the amount of rocks in the river. The bigger the resistance, the lower the current. | Light bulb, Toaster, etc. |

* **Resistors in Series:** All resistors are connected end to end. There is only one river, so they all receive the same current. But since there is a voltage drop across each resistor, they may all have different voltages across them – the sum of the voltage drops will equal the total voltage of the circuit. The more resistors in series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows.

__$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots$__

$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots$

* **Resistors in Parallel:** All resistors are connected together at both ends. There are many rivers (i.e. the main river branches off into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts of current. But since they are all connected to the same point at both ends they all receive the same voltage.

__$\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots$__

$\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots$

* **Direct Current (DC):** Voltage pushes (so current flows) in one direction. Examples are batteries and the power supplies we use in class. Any time there’s a boxy device you plug into the wall (like a charger), its purpose is to convert AC from the wall to DC.
* **Alternating Current (AC):** Voltage pushes (so current flows) in alternate directions, back and forth. In the US they reverse direction 60 times a second (60 Hz). AC is more convenient than DC for transporting electrical energy. Below is a plot of voltage vs. time for a standard circuit in the USA.

_Note: your TV and computer screen are actually flickering at 60 Hz due to the AC supplied by household plugs. Our eyesight does not work this fast, so we never notice it. However, if you film a TV the effect is observable due to the mismatched frame rates of the camera (usually 24 fps) and screen._

![0](media/148.png "Figure 4: * **Ammeter:** A device that measures electric current. You must break the circuit to measure the current. Ammeters have very low resistance; therefore you must wire them in series.")
* **Voltmeter:** A device that measures voltage. In order to measure a voltage difference between two points, place the probes down on the wires for the two points. Do not break the circuit. Voltmeters have very high resistance; therefore you must wire them in parallel.
* **Voltage source:** A power source that produces fixed voltage regardless of what is hooked up to it. A battery is a real-life voltage source. A battery can be thought of as a perfect voltage source with a small resistor (called internal resistance) in series. The electric energy density produced by the chemistry of the battery is called **emf** (electromotive force), but the amount of voltage available from the battery is called **terminal voltage**. The terminal voltage equals the emf minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance (current of the external circuit times the internal resistance.)

**Conservation of Energy & Electrical Efficiency:**

Electrical energy is useful to us mostly because it is easy to transport and can be easily converted to or from other forms of energy. Of course, conversion involves wast, typically as heat.

Electrical energy consumed can be determined by multiplying power by time $(E = Pt)$. Recall the equations for mechanical and thermal energy/work $(PE=mgh, KE=1/2mv^2, Q=mc \Delta T)$. An important idea is the _efficiency_ of an electrical device: the fraction of electrical energy consumed that goes into doing useful work $(W_{out}/E_{in})$, expressed as a percentage.

**_Example:_**

You use a 100 W electric motor to lift a 10 kg mass 5 m, and it takes 20 s.

The electrical energy consumed is $E_{elec} = P \cdot t = (100 \ W) (20 \ s) = 2000 \ J$

The work done is against gravity, so we use $PE = mgh = (10 \ kg) (10 \ m/s^2) (5 \ m) = 500 \ J$

The efficiency is $W_{out}/E_{in} = (500 \ J) / (2000 \ J) = 0.25 = 25. \ \text{efficient}$

**3 Example Problems for Circuits**

1) A circuit is wired up with two resistors in series.

![0](media/149.png "Figure 5: Both resistors are in the same ‘river’, so both have the same current flowing through them. Neither resistor has a direct connection to the power supply so neither has 20V across it. But the combined voltages across the individual resistors add up to 20V.")

**Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?

**Answer:** The total resistance is $R_{total}=R_1+R_2=90 \Omega+10 \Omega=100 \Omega$

**Question:** What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s Law $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$.

$$
I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=\frac{20V}{100\Omega}=0.20A
$$

**Question:** How much power does the power supply dissipate?

**Answer:** $P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(0.20A)(20V)=4.0W$. So the Power Supply is outputting 4W (i.e. 4 Joules of energy per second).

**Question:** How much power does each resistor dissipate?

**Answer:** Each resistor has different voltage across it, but the same current. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on voltage.

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=IV=I(IR)=I^2R.\\
P_{90 \Omega} &= I^2_{90\Omega}R_{90\Omega}=(0.2A)^2(90\Omega)=3.6W\\
P_{10 \Omega} &= I^2_{10\Omega}R_{10\Omega}=(0.2A)^2(10\Omega)=0.4W
\end{align*}
$$

$^*$Note: If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

**Question:** How much voltage is there across each resistor?

**Answer:** In order to calculate voltage across a resistor, use Ohm’s law.

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{90\Omega} &= I_{90\Omega}R_{90\Omega}=(0.2A)(90\Omega)=18V\\
V_{10\Omega} &= I_{10\Omega}R_{10\Omega}=(0.2A)(10\Omega)=2V
\end{align*}
$$

$^*$Note: If you add up the voltages across the individual resistors you will obtain the total voltage of the circuit, as you should. Further note that with the voltages we can use the original form of the Power equation $(P=IV)$, and we should get the same results as above.

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{90\Omega} &= I_{90\Omega}V_{90\Omega}=(18V)(0.2A)=3.6W\\
P_{10\Omega} &= I_{10\Omega}V_{10\Omega}=(2.0V)(0.2A)=0.4W
\end{align*}
$$

2) A circuit is wired up with 2 resistors in parallel.

![0](media/150.png "Figure 6: Both resistors are directly connected to the power supply, so both have the same 20V across them. But they are on different ‘rivers’ so they have different current flowing through them. Lets go through the same questions and answers as with the circuit in series.")

**Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?

**Answer:** The total resistance is $\frac{1}{R_{total}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}=\frac{1}{90\Omega}+\frac{1}{10\Omega}=\frac{1}{90\Omega}+\frac{9}{90\Omega}=\frac{10}{90\Omega}$ thus, $R_{total}=\frac{90\Omega}{10}=9\Omega$

$^*$Note: Total resistance for a circuit in parallel will always be smaller than smallest resistor in the circuit.

**Question:** What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s Law $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$.

$$
I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=\frac{20V}{9\Omega}=2.2A
$$

**Question:** How much power does the power supply dissipate?

**Answer:** $P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(2.2A)(20V)=44.4W$. So the Power Supply outputs 44W (i.e. 44 Joules of energy per second).

**Question:** How much power is each resistor dissipating?

**Answer:** Each resistor has different current across it, but the same voltage. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that does not depend on current. $P=IV=\left(\frac{V}{R}\right) V=\frac{V^2}{R}$ Substituted $I=V/R$ into the power formula. $P_{90\Omega}=\frac{V^2_{90\Omega}}{R_{90\Omega}}=\frac{(20V)^2}{90\Omega}=4.4W; P_{10\Omega}=\frac{V^2_{10\Omega}}{R_{10}\Omega}=\frac{(20V)^2}{10\Omega}=40W$

$^*$Note: If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

**Question:** How much current is flowing through each resistor?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s law to calculate the current for each resistor.

$$
I_{90\Omega}=\frac{V_{90\Omega}}{R_{90\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{90\Omega}=0.22A \qquad I_{10\Omega}=\frac{V_{10\Omega}}{R_{10\Omega}}=\frac{20V}{10\Omega}=2.0A
$$

Notice that the $10\Omega$ resistor has the most current going through it. It has the least resistance to electricity so this makes sense.

$^*$Note: If you add up the currents of the individual ‘rivers’ you get the total current of the of the circuit, as you should.

3) A more complicated circuit is analyzed.

![0](media/151.png "Figure 7: **Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?")

**Answer:** In order to find the total resistance we do it in steps (see pictures. First add the $90 \Omega$ and $10\Omega$ in series to make one equivalent resistance of $100\Omega$ (see diagram at right). Then add the $100\Omega$ to the $10\Omega$ in parallel to get one resistor of $9.1\Omega$. Now we have two resistors in series, simply add them to get the total resistance of $29.1\Omega$.

![0](media/152.png "Figure 8: **Question:** What is the total current coming out of the power supply?")

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s Law $(V=IR)$ but solve for current $(I=V/R)$. $I_{total}=\frac{V_{total}}{R_{total}}=20V/2.91\Omega=0.69\ Amps$

![0](media/153.png "Figure 9: **Question:** What is the power dissipated by the power supply?")

**Answer:** $P=IV$, so the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total current. Thus, $P_{total}=I_{total}V_{total}=(0.69A)(20V)=13.8W$.

**Question:** How much power is the $20\Omega$ resistor dissipating?

**Answer:** The $20\Omega$ has the full 0.69Amps running through it because it is part of the ‘main river’ (this is not the case for the other resistors because the current splits). $P_{20 \Omega} = I^2_{20 \Omega} R_{20 \Omega} = (0.69A)^2 (20 \Omega) = 9.5W$

![0](media/154.png "Figure 10: **Question:** If these resistors are light bulbs, order them from brightest to least bright.")

**Answer:** The brightness of a light bulb is directly given by the power dissipated. So we could go through each resistor as we did the $20\Omega$ guy and calculate the power then simply order them. But, we can also think it out. For the guys in parallel the current splits with most of the current going through the $10\Omega$ path (less resistance) and less going through the $90\Omega+10\Omega$ path. Well the second path is ten times the resistance of the first, so it will have one tenth of the total current. Thus, there is approximately and 0.069 Amps going through the $90\Omega$ and $10\Omega$ path and 0.621Amps going through the $10\Omega$ path.

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{10 \Omega} &= I^2_{10\Omega}R_{10 \Omega}=(0.621A)^2(10\Omega)=3.8W\\
P_{90+10\Omega} &= I^2_{90+10\Omega}R_{90 + 10 \Omega}=(0.069A)^2(100\Omega)=0.5W
\end{align*}
$$

We now know that the $20\Omega$ is the brightest, $10\Omega$ is second and then the $90\Omega$ and last the $10\Omega$ (-these last two have same current flowing through them, so $90\Omega$ is brighter due to its higher resistance).

$^*$Note: Adding up these two plus the 9.5W from the $20\Omega$ resistor gives us 13.8W, which is the total power previously calculated, so we have confidence everything is good.
